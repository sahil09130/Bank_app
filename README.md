I've just completed a projectâ€”a fully responsive business landing page website called Hoobank. It was developed using React JS and Tailwind CSS. Check it out here: Website Link
âœ¨ Designed with Modern UI/UX in mind, Hoobank showcases a sleek layout and offers a seamless browsing experience. I used the Figma design as a reference to ensure pixel-perfect implementation. Explore the Figma design here: Figma Design Link
ðŸ’¡ Powered by React JS and styled with Tailwind CSS, this project highlights the synergy between the two technologies. Experience the captivating design, smooth scrolling, interactive animations, and user-friendly sections.
